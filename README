A library that offers three special functions:

    hyp2f1 - the Gauss hypergeometric function (for 0<|z|< 1!)
    hyp1f1 - confluent hypergeometric function (for 0<|z|< 1!)
    pcfd - parabolic cylinder functions

the bonus in comparison to most existing implementations is:
    - they can operate on numpy arrays
    - they take complex arguments everywhere

if libspecfunc.so is found, fast c implementations are used 
(see specfunc.c), otherwise the system falls back to the slower
but excellent mpmath python library

before using for the first time, compile the c library (see compile.sh)

needs the numpy and mpmath python libraries to be installed
